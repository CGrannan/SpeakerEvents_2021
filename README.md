   * **March 2021 - Network Neuroscience**
      * Speaker: [Dr. Linden Parkes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindenparkes/)
      * Detail: Network Neuroscience is focused on using the tools and techniques from network science to study the brain. Casting the brain as a network of spatially distributed but interconnected units (brain regions) is an intuitive way to formalize and probe our understanding of brain structure and function. Network neuroscientists seek answers to a broad range of questions such as: how is the brainâ€™s complex network organized? How does this organization enable us to engage in sophisticated behaviors? What are the processes that shape the development of this complex network? And to what extent do disruptions to this network link to mental disorder? In this presentation, I will provide an overview of how network neuroscientists analyze data acquired from Magnetic Resonance Imaging; a common imaging technique for studying the human brain in vivo. I will also provide insight into how the Data Science skillset is critical to being a network neuroscientist and will illustrate examples of my own work in the field.
